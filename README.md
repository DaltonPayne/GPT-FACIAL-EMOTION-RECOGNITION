# GPT-FACIAL-EMOTION-RECOGNITION
This project is an basic emotion recognition system that combines OpenAI's GPT API and a deep learning model trained on the FER2013 dataset. It detects facial emotions in real-time from a webcam feed and generates AI responses based on the user's emotion. The project is implemented using TensorFlow, OpenCV, and OpenAI's API
